JavaScript Basics
Background Context
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for both scripting and web front-end development. In this project, we will focus on the basics of JavaScript to understand its fundamental concepts. Later, we will apply these concepts to make our AirBnB project dynamic using JavaScript and JQuery.

Learning Objectives
Explain the significance of JavaScript programming.
Run a JavaScript script.
Create variables and constants.
Differentiate between var, const, and let.
Identify and use all available data types in JavaScript.
Utilize if, if ... else statements for control flow.
Write comments in JavaScript code.
Assign values to variables.
Implement while and for loops.
Use break and continue statements in loops.
Define functions and understand their usage.
Identify the return value of a function without a return statement.
Understand variable scope.
Use arithmetic operators and manipulate dictionaries.
Import files in JavaScript.
Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
All files end with a new line
The first line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/node
Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
Code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x) with semicolons
All files must be executable
Tasks
Scripting Basics

Create a JavaScript script that prints "Hello, JavaScript!" to the console.
Variables and Constants

Declare a variable x and assign it a value of 10.
Declare a constant PI and assign it the value of π (3.14159).
Data Types

Create variables of different data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
Control Flow

Use if, if ... else statements to display different messages based on the value of a variable.
Loops

Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
Use a for loop to iterate over an array and print each element.
Functions

Create a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum.
Create a function that takes an array as a parameter and returns the average of its elements.
Comments

Add comments to your code explaining the purpose of each function and control flow statement.
Scope

Declare a variable inside a function and try to access it outside the function. Explain the result.
Operators

Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
Use comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=) to compare values.
Dictionary Manipulation

Create an object with key-value pairs representing a person's information (name, age, etc.).
Use dot notation and bracket notation to access and update values in the object.
